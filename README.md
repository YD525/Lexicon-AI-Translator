# Lexicon AI Translator

**Lexicon AI Translator** is a free, open-source tool for Skyrim mod localization.
It supports multiple mod-related file formats, including PEX, ESM, ESP, and MCM.
The tool focuses on structured string preprocessing, rule-based protection, and customizable translation workflows to reduce errors during batch translation.
With optional integration of local or online translation engines and user-defined dictionaries, Lexicon AI Translator helps translators work more efficiently while maintaining control over the final output.

If you want to give feedback, report issues, or discuss Lex Translator, please feel free to visit any of the following sites:  

- [Nexus Mods (for international users)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143056)  

You can download it directly from Nexus Mods or build it yourself here. Both versions are kept up to date.

Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated!

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   [https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine](https://github.com/YD525/PhoenixEngine)

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.

3. After building, make sure to **reference the generated DLLs** (e.g., `PhoenixEngine.dll`) in the **Lex Translator** project.  
   You can do this either by adding project references or linking the compiled DLLs directly.

This step is **mandatory** — the LexTranslator project will not build correctly without it.

## 📜 Translation & Localization Exception

I’m happy to allow translators to localize the Lexicon AI Translator and share their work with others.  
**Therefore, a specific exception is allowed for translators to distribute localized versions of this project, strictly limited to localization purposes only.**  
Please note that this exception **does not extend to modification, redistribution, or derivative works beyond translation**.  

The original author assumes no responsibility or liability for any issues arising from translated versions.

## 😼 YD525’s Selfishness

YD525 uses a dual-license model for a very simple reason:  
YD525 really loves the software they write — and wants to keep full control over it~

This project is a long-term passion, not a disposable experiment.  
The dual-license exists to protect that passion and the freedom to move forward without regrets.

Selfish? Maybe.  
Honest? Absolutely.
